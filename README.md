 Problem Statement: Breast Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide and cases are increasing steadily year by year which increases the mortality rate of the women worldwide. So, early diagnosis and detection is necessary for breast cancer.  Past CAD (Computer-Aided Diagnosis) systems showed the potential for improving accuracy using different models and methods like Na√Øve Bayes' & CNN. But it has a lot of limitations like less accuracy, small datasets & random image selection. So, there was the need for such a model that can solve the above problems with high efficiency and accuracy.  So, we proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based CAD model using multi-modal datasets, which helps to extract important features and properties like automated feature extraction, high-level feature using transfer learning and data augmentation techniques which were missing in the past models which helps in achieving high accuracy rate in breast cancer detection.
