 Problem Statement: Breast Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide and cases are increasing steadily year by year which increases the mortality rate of the women worldwide. So, early diagnosis and detection is necessary for breast cancer.  Past CAD (Computer-Aided Diagnosis) systems showed the potential for improving accuracy using different models and methods like Naïve Bayes' & CNN. But it has a lot of limitations like less accuracy, small datasets & random image selection. So, there was the need for such a model that can solve the above problems with high efficiency and accuracy.  So, we proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based CAD model using multi-modal datasets, which helps to extract important features and properties like automated feature extraction, high-level feature using transfer learning and data augmentation techniques which were missing in the past models which helps in achieving high accuracy rate in breast cancer detection.


CNN Based CAD Model:

CNN-based model for breast cancer typically involves the use of mammogram images or other medical images for early detection and diagnosis .It can be implemented by:
1. Collect data of mammogram image datasets of breast cancer.
2. Preprocessing mammogram dataset to enhance the images and reduce noise.
3. Designing a CNN for image classification which consists of multiple convolutional layers and one pooling layer.
4. Training the CNN Model using techniques such as transfer learning, and different learning methods.
5. Testing the trained CNN Model on new, unlabeled mammogram images  for cancer detection
6. Validate the CNN Model to evaluate the performance metrics.

Proposed model consists of 3 stages: Image pre-processing, Image data augmentation and Training CNN model with different pooling techniques and Performance Evaluation. CNN model comprises of 5 layers: Convolutional, Activation, Batch normalization, Pooling and Fully connected layer.
This CNN based CAD model’s main aim is to minimize the number of layers, computational cost, and parameters, maximize the learning speed, and provide good accuracy compared to various previous models.
